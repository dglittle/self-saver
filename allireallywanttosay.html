All I Really Want To Say Is
By Greg Little

If I knew I would die tomorrow, and someone asked what I'd like to tell the world before I left, this is what it would be, currently. If I live past tomorrow, and what I would want to say changes, I'll update this so that if I ever do die, it'll be "ready to go", so to speak.

* I think that people, after their basic needs are met, naturally want to do interesting things. I also think that many people are, by nature, altruistic, and want to do interesting things that benefit everyone.

* I think that the world is facing many huge challenges, yet not allocating its mental resources toward solving those problems.

* I think America can afford to meet the basic needs of all its residents. I think it would prosper itself and also start helping the world if it did this.

* I think that I am a slave to rich people. I feel like my options are:
    1. work for someone who can afford to pay me, i.e., rich.
    2. beg or otherwise take advantage of my friends who choose option 1.
    3. die (though this option is not legal)

* I think that issues like abortion, immigration and "the middle east" are inordinately complicated, and nobody really understands them, not even our nations leaders, or anybody that we could elect in their place. I think we need to figure out how to harness collective wisdom.

* I think that a democracy would be better than the system we currently have for government, at each level. I think we have the technology now. We don't need everyone to gather in a Colosseum. We could have an app. The open source community would probably make it for free.

* I think there is a tendency in western culture, especially in men, to value reason above intuition. I think this is a mistake. In my experience, the only thing that stands in the way of coming up with a better argument is cleverness, not truth.

* I think people undervalue "reinventing the wheel".





* I think people undervalue multiple people solving the same problem. Perhaps this is because they feel that only one solution is needed, however, not all solutions are equally good.


Not all solutions are equally good. In fact, in my experience, the best solutions appear when multiple groups try to solve a problem independently.




* I think an undervalued tool in the world today is having multiple indepent groups try to solve a problem independtly, and then comparing their solutions.

* I think that people tend to undervalue doing what is actually most efficient for themselves in favor of making use of something they spent time learning.

* I am afraid to go to jail. I resent it. I fear being raped, and I feel like I'm essentially being threatened with rape to not do things that someone else has decided I shouldn't do.

* I think suicide should be legal. I think people should be allowed to kill themselves with heroin. I think that the right to take our own lives is our most basic right.

* I think patents and copyrights are slowing progress. I think people underestimate the negative impact on the mind of a researcher or artist to need to restrict their creativity in these ways.

* I think lawsuits are slowing progress.

* I think fire drills do more harm than good.

* I think that an efficient algorithm for deciding what to do is: think of the furthest out goal that we're trying to achieve, then think of the most immediate step that we could take in that direction.

* I think people tend to overestimate how well they can think when dealing with multiple problems simultaneously.



6. Patents and copyrights are not good. They cause harm, and they don't accomplish their goals. The harm they cause is that they add friction to ideation and creativity. It is very difficult to explain to the subconscious mind: don't think X, because it is patented, and don't incorporate too much of Y, because it is copyrighted. The hope, in both cases, is to allow people to monetize ideas and creativity, to encourage them to come up with ideas and be creative. However, it turns out, people do not need incentive to come up with ideas and be creative. I've met these people, and if they had enough money to live, they'd work on coming up with ideas and being creative anyway. Of course, some scientific or creative pursuits require expensive equipment, and in these cases, I think the government should make such equipment available in the same way it makes books available at libraries, to anyone who wants to use it, on a first-come-first-serve basis. But what about our fancy drugs, and major motion pictures? My guess is that all the best drugs and movies would get funded on kickstarter, in which case people would essentially pay upfront for the creation of something which then becomes public domain. With that said, because we currently don't pay people a living wage just to exist, we *should* be paying artists, and we should be paying them directly, rather than paying most of the money to publishers as we currently do. The way that makes the most sense to me is if people willingly use software to track what art they consume (books, videos, images, games, etc.), and then pay a fixed monthly art budget divided between all of those artists according to how much time was spent consuming their art. This would eliminate the need for ads.

7. Ads affect us more than we think. I feel like most people's attitudes toward ads is "I see the ad and choose whether I want to buy the product or not". This is not what happens. This is not how our brains work. Our brains consume all media in a parallel fashion, and we see a small sliver of the effect consciously. It's not that ads control us and make us do things against our will, it is more that they influence us, nudging us in various directions, and making connections between things that generally make no sense, like connecting thoughts of thirst to thoughts of a particular brand of drink. And we're generally right when we think that we are capable of thinking of that brand of drink and choosing not to buy it, but the more difficult thing is breaking the association so that thoughts of thirst do not bring up thoughts of that brand of drink in the first place.

7. We have an irrational fear of psychedelic drugs, like LSD. Steve Jobs took LSD. Psychedelic drugs are the most interesting thing I've ever experienced. If I could recommend only one thing for people to add to their bucket list, it would be to try LSD. Now, it can be very scary, and frankly, the fact that it is illegal adds to that fear for me. That is to say, LSD would be an even more effective and beneficial drug for people if it wasn't illegal, because people could take it in a more pleasant non-fearful state of mind, and they'd know that what they were taking really was LSD. I do think it's worth educating people about LSD, and its risks, and maybe requiring that people be 21 to buy it or whatever, but making it illegal seems ridiculous. One day I fear going to jail for doing LSD, which I find ironic, because I'm kind and respectful to everyone I meet, and I'll be in jail getting raped for doing LSD as various clever politicians and business people grab more power and money in perfectly legal ways that hurt everyone but themselves.

8. It seems, from what I can tell, that there really is a mental phenomena one might call "enlightenment", and it seems to be the ability to, at will, calm one's mind completely. It doesn't mean that the person is always calm, but just that they could become so if they wanted. Being calm is sort of like rebooting a computer, which, for whatever reason, is generally the solution to most computer problems, and our brains are basically computers, and it's good to know how to reset them. The thing that generally stands in the way of becoming truly calm is fears and worries, like "I might forget my appointment tomorrow", or "I might do something stupid if I don't constantly keep in mind the conviction to not do stupid things". And we're generally right -- we could forget the appointment, and do a stupid thing, but the solution isn't to never become calm, the solution is to generally not have appointments to keep (or have a reliable reminder for them that doesn't involve our brain needing to remember anything), and not worrying about doing stupid things, which we generally want to do sometimes anyway, like dance our hearts out to a song. It's just that we're worried about other people judging us, and that's a fear we need to remove to become truly calm. Also, falling asleep is not the same as being calm. It is possible to be uncalm when we enter sleep, and to still be uncalm when we wake up. Also, it seems that just knowing intellectually that being calm is good is insufficient to make it happen. It seems to require practice calming the mind, like meditation, or similar practices, including psychedelic drugs.

10. We are fine paying a 3% transaction fee on every transaction. We should not be fine with that. If you take $100 and pass it through 23 such transactions, half of it has been lost to transaction fees. It's like we're all playing poker in a giant casino, but the casino is taking a percent of every hand that's played, and so at the end of the night, everyone leaves with less than they started, no matter how well they play. Note that 3% transaction fees are actually *more* than the rake casinos take from poker players. Casinos have a "max amount" that they'll take from a hand, no matter how large it is, so on a really big hand, the casino takes a smaller percentage than it takes on a small hand. And this actually makes sense: the casino is essentially getting paid to "run the game", but it doesn't cost more to run the game if more money is on the table for a particular hand. The real cost was having the dealer sit there and deal the hand. Likewise, the real cost to transaction processors is a small bit of bandwidth and server time, which costs much less than a cent. It did cost money to set up the infrastructure, but that is paid off very quickly, and then the system is just a continuous funnel of most of all the worlds money into the hands of transaction processors. Really, this is the sort of thing that makes sense for a government to handle (not saying bitcoin is bad, they can coexist), but the government already spends a lot of money printing physical currency, and it would actually be cheaper to run and maintain an internet-cash transaction processing thing that doesn't charge a transaction fee. It's infrastructure, like a road, and we desperately need it, because right now we're driving down roads where the toll booths charge 3% of whatever is in our car.

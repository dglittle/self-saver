All I Really Want To Say Is
By Greg Little

If I knew I would die tomorrow, and someone asked what I'd like to tell the world before I left, this is what it would be, currently. If I live past tomorrow, and what I would want to say changes, I'll update this so that if I ever do die, it'll be "ready to go", so to speak.

1. I get the impression from our culture that most people believe if we just paid everyone an honest living wage, for no reason, letting people do whatever they wanted with their time, that people would choose to be lazy slobs and we'd make no progress. I don't think that's true. I think that the exact opposite would happen. I mean, I think people would be lazy slobs for like a couple weeks, or even six months, because they're so exhausted from their current jobs, but after that, I think they would think "how can I make myself useful, so that other people are glad to have me around?"


 if a country paid all it's people a living wage as a baseline, and let capitalism operate on top of that, they'd be more productive than silicon valley. Though, in that country, the wage paid to janitors would be very very high, but it should be very very high, because it is unpleasant to mop up poop. Also, incidentally, if someone *has* to work in order to live in a capitalist economy, it is slavery, we just get to chose our master from a small set of rich masters, and they're not allowed to whip us, which, I grant, is awesome. They do, however, get 40 hours a week of our time, which is practically all of our creative energy, and that sucks, and they generally want us to do things which make them richer, rather than things that will help the world, which also sucks.

2. Our culture tells us to "take a side" on political issues, don't sit on the fence. This is not good. Most political issues are ridiculously complicated, and involve complex interactions with many other issues. It is not just that we disagree, it is that we don't know the solutions to these problems. We need to spend time figuring them out rather than being sure we're right and not understanding why half of everyone else disagrees with us.

3. Our culture tends to value "reason" above "intuition". This is not good. Reason is a useful tool, especially for math and physics, but in my experience, it is no match for intuition at thinking about organic systems, especially ones involving humans. Also, as far as I can tell, for any reason that someone can come up with in favor of a political or ethical stance, someone clever can come up with an even more compelling reason for the opposite stance. That is, reason is not very trustworthy in these cases. A much more reliable thing is if multiple people come to the same conclusions about how to solve some problem independently. In most situations where I have seen reason used, it would be more efficient and achieve better results for all parties involved if people limited their words to saying what they want and how they feel, rather than giving reasons for things.

5. It is not good for jails to be punitive. We don't even know for sure if the people in jail did anything wrong. The real use of jail is to keep people that we're afraid will hurt us from hurting us. Currently, I'm terrified of jail. I think I'd get raped there. That seems cruel and unusual. "So don't commit any crimes," you might say, but remember, I don't need to commit a crime to go to jail. I've actually been a police officer's suspect for a crime and might have driven away in his car if I wasn't lucky enough to be able to give him a number he could call to verify my alibi on the spot, and he was willing to call the number, and my alibi picked up what must have looked like a sales person calling.

4. We are not a democracy. We say that democracy is the worst system, except for all the others, yet our system is one of those even worse "other" systems. And the thing is, we *could* be a democracy. We could actually have the entire nation vote on issues, rather than electing officials to do that. Some might worry that this would be too much voting, but if someone felt they didn't have time to know about all the issues, they could delegate votes to certain people that they trust better in those issues, but if they did care about a particular issue, then they could vote on it directly. Anyway, we have the technology. Seems silly to keep a republic when we could have the least worst system of them all.

5. We make suicide illegal. This is not good. If we had just one right in the bill of rights, it should be the right to die, if we want. It does cause pain to others. I've had two friends commit suicide, and I've felt that pain. But I don't hold it against either of them. In a sense, life is a game, and it's not a particularly fair game, and it seems awfully selfish of the winning players to say that the losing players need to keep playing the game, especially in a game where the losing players literally spend most of their time doing the bidding of the winning players. And if someone wants to do a lot of heroin before dying, that seems perfectly fine, I mean, that seems like the perfect time to do heroin.

6. Patents and copyrights are not good. They cause harm, and they don't accomplish their goals. The harm they cause is that they add friction to ideation and creativity. It is very difficult to explain to the subconscious mind: don't think X, because it is patented, and don't incorporate too much of Y, because it is copyrighted. The hope, in both cases, is to allow people to monetize ideas and creativity, to encourage them to come up with ideas and be creative. However, it turns out, people do not need incentive to come up with ideas and be creative. I've met these people, and if they had enough money to live, they'd work on coming up with ideas and being creative anyway. Of course, some scientific or creative pursuits require expensive equipment, and in these cases, I think the government should make such equipment available in the same way it makes books available at libraries, to anyone who wants to use it, on a first-come-first-serve basis. But what about our fancy drugs, and major motion pictures? My guess is that all the best drugs and movies would get funded on kickstarter, in which case people would essentially pay upfront for the creation of something which then becomes public domain. With that said, because we currently don't pay people a living wage just to exist, we *should* be paying artists, and we should be paying them directly, rather than paying most of the money to publishers as we currently do. The way that makes the most sense to me is if people willingly use software to track what art they consume (books, videos, images, games, etc.), and then pay a fixed monthly art budget divided between all of those artists according to how much time was spent consuming their art. This would eliminate the need for ads.

7. Ads affect us more than we think. I feel like most people's attitudes toward ads is "I see the ad and choose whether I want to buy the product or not". This is not what happens. This is not how our brains work. Our brains consume all media in a parallel fashion, and we see a small sliver of the effect consciously. It's not that ads control us and make us do things against our will, it is more that they influence us, nudging us in various directions, and making connections between things that generally make no sense, like connecting thoughts of thirst to thoughts of a particular brand of drink. And we're generally right when we think that we are capable of thinking of that brand of drink and choosing not to buy it, but the more difficult thing is breaking the association so that thoughts of thirst do not bring up thoughts of that brand of drink in the first place.

7. We have an irrational fear of psychedelic drugs, like LSD. Steve Jobs took LSD. Psychedelic drugs are the most interesting thing I've ever experienced. If I could recommend only one thing for people to add to their bucket list, it would be to try LSD. Now, it can be very scary, and frankly, the fact that it is illegal adds to that fear for me. That is to say, LSD would be an even more effective and beneficial drug for people if it wasn't illegal, because people could take it in a more pleasant non-fearful state of mind, and they'd know that what they were taking really was LSD. I do think it's worth educating people about LSD, and its risks, and maybe requiring that people be 21 to buy it or whatever, but making it illegal seems ridiculous. One day I fear going to jail for doing LSD, which I find ironic, because I'm kind and respectful to everyone I meet, and I'll be in jail getting raped for doing LSD as various clever politicians and business people grab more power and money in perfectly legal ways that hurt everyone but themselves.

8. It seems, from what I can tell, that there really is a mental phenomena one might call "enlightenment", and it seems to be the ability to, at will, calm one's mind completely. It doesn't mean that the person is always calm, but just that they could become so if they wanted. Being calm is sort of like rebooting a computer, which, for whatever reason, is generally the solution to most computer problems, and our brains are basically computers, and it's good to know how to reset them. The thing that generally stands in the way of becoming truly calm is fears and worries, like "I might forget my appointment tomorrow", or "I might do something stupid if I don't constantly keep in mind the conviction to not do stupid things". And we're generally right -- we could forget the appointment, and do a stupid thing, but the solution isn't to never become calm, the solution is to generally not have appointments to keep (or have a reliable reminder for them that doesn't involve our brain needing to remember anything), and not worrying about doing stupid things, which we generally want to do sometimes anyway, like dance our hearts out to a song. It's just that we're worried about other people judging us, and that's a fear we need to remove to become truly calm. Also, falling asleep is not the same as being calm. It is possible to be uncalm when we enter sleep, and to still be uncalm when we wake up. Also, it seems that just knowing intellectually that being calm is good is insufficient to make it happen. It seems to require practice calming the mind, like meditation, or similar practices, including psychedelic drugs.

10. We are fine paying a 3% transaction fee on every transaction. We should not be fine with that. If you take $100 and pass it through 23 such transactions, half of it has been lost to transaction fees. It's like we're all playing poker in a giant casino, but the casino is taking a percent of every hand that's played, and so at the end of the night, everyone leaves with less than they started, no matter how well they play. Note that 3% transaction fees are actually *more* than the rake casinos take from poker players. Casinos have a "max amount" that they'll take from a hand, no matter how large it is, so on a really big hand, the casino takes a smaller percentage than it takes on a small hand. And this actually makes sense: the casino is essentially getting paid to "run the game", but it doesn't cost more to run the game if more money is on the table for a particular hand. The real cost was having the dealer sit there and deal the hand. Likewise, the real cost to transaction processors is a small bit of bandwidth and server time, which costs much less than a cent. It did cost money to set up the infrastructure, but that is paid off very quickly, and then the system is just a continuous funnel of most of all the worlds money into the hands of transaction processors. Really, this is the sort of thing that makes sense for a government to handle (not saying bitcoin is bad, they can coexist), but the government already spends a lot of money printing physical currency, and it would actually be cheaper to run and maintain an internet-cash transaction processing thing that doesn't charge a transaction fee. It's infrastructure, like a road, and we desperately need it, because right now we're driving down roads where the toll booths charge 3% of whatever is in our car.
